## News Homepage

- Efforts were made to incorporate **accessibility** features in the News Homepage project.
- Semantic elements like `nav`, `article`, `section`, and attributes such as `aria-hidden`, `aria-labelledby` and `aria-expanded` were used for **screen readers**.
- A dynamically changing **tab order** based on the opening or closing of the mobile menu was coded for users who navigate the site with a **keyboard only**.
- Users can navigate through the menu using the tab key when it's open and when closed, buttons and links become accessible again.
- Additionally, using the `picture` and `source` element and the `srcset` attribute, different versions of the same image for mobile and desktop devices were implemented in the code.
- The layout was created using grid and flex properties and I utilized the newly added **subgrid** feature in CSS.
